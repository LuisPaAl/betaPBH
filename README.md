PBHs (Primordial Black Holes) are hypothesized to form from the gravitational collapse of very dense regions in the early universe, when the density fluctuations were large enough to overcome the pressure of the gas and radiation.

The formation of PBHs in the early universe can have a significant impact on the subsequent evolution of the universe. The radiation emitted by PBHs during their formation can reheat the universe after the end of inflation, which is the rapid expansion of the universe in the first moments after the Big Bang. PBHs can also affect the formation and evolution of structures in the universe. They can act as seeds for the formation of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and other large structures. The interaction of PBHs with other matter in the universe, such as dark matter and gas, can also lead to the formation of compact objects, such as stars and planets.

Moreover, the presence of PBHs in the early universe can affect the production of the light elements, such as hydrogen and helium, during the Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The energy released by PBHs can alter the abundance of these elements and leave a detectable imprint in the cosmic microwave background radiation.

Overall, PBHs are an important aspect of the early universe and can provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the universe.
