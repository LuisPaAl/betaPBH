# {math}`\beta`-PBH

betaPBH is a Python library for **computing abundances of primordial black holes 
(PBHs) in Early Universe.** 


```{warning}
This project is under heavy development.
```

## Requeriments

1. **Python 3.6 or later:** The betaPBH library requires Python 3.6 or later to be installed on your system.

```{note}
This code runs both in Python 2x and 3x. However, we highly recommend Python 3x. In the github repository and pypi package contains the basic libraries to run `betaPBH`, but this dependences need import into notebook or in the console to functions be available.
```

2. **pip package manager:** The pip package manager is used to install betaPBH and its dependencies. It should be included with your Python installation by default.

3. **NumPy and SciPy libraries:** The NumPy and SciPy libraries are required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. These libraries provide support for numerical computations and scientific computing in Python.

4. **Matplotlib library:** The Matplotlib library is also required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. This library provides support for creating various types of charts and graphs in Python.
