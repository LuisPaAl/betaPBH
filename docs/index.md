# {math}`\beta`-PBH

betaPBH is a Python library for **computing abundances of primordial black holes 
(PBHs) in Early.** It provides a framework for simulating the formation and 
evolution of PBHs, and for predicting their abundance in a given cosmological 
scenario. The library includes various modules for computing the mass function, 
merger history, and observational constraints on PBHs. It can be used to explore a 
wide range of cosmological models and to study the implications of PBHs for 
astrophysics, particle physics, and cosmology. The library is open-source and can 
be freely downloaded and modified for research purposes.


## Requeriments

1. **Python 3.6 or later:** The betaPBH library requires Python 3.6 or later to be installed on your system.

2. **pip package manager:** The pip package manager is used to install betaPBH and its dependencies. It should be included with your Python installation by default.

3. **NumPy and SciPy libraries:** The NumPy and SciPy libraries are required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. These libraries provide support for numerical computations and scientific computing in Python.

4. **C++ compiler:** A C++ compiler is required to compile the Cython extensions used in betaPBH. On Windows systems, this can be installed by installing Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools or Microsoft Visual Studio. On Unix-based systems, this can be installed using the system package manager (e.g., apt-get on Ubuntu).

5. **Cython:** Cython is required to compile the Cython extensions used in betaPBH. This can be installed using pip.


```{note}
This code runs both in Python 2x and 3x. However, we highly recommend Python 3x. In  the github repository or pypi package contains the basic libraries to run `betaPBH`, but this dependences need import into notebook or in the console to functions be available.
