# PBH-{math}`\beta`

PBH-{math}`\beta` is a Python library for **computing the constraints in the abundances of primordial black holes 
(PBHs) in nonstandard cosmologies.** This code was writen by M.Sc. Tadeo D. GÃ³mez and Dr. Luis E. Padilla.

In this documentation you will find how to use the PBH-{math}`\beta` code, as well as examples and many of the files and figures generated during testing.

PBH-{math}`\beta` constitutes a straightforward code writen in Python, which allows the calculation of the  
constraints in the abundances of PBHs in different scenarios of evolution of the early universe. For example, in 
the standard (radiation-dominated) scenario of PBH formation, as well as other  more exotic scenarios, such as 
an early period of matter domination (generated by a prolonged  reheating, for example) or a stiff-like evolution 
post-inflation.

## Requeriments

1. **Python 3.6 or later:** The betaPBH library requires Python 3.6 or later to be installed on your system.

```{note}
This code runs both in Python 2x and 3x. However, we highly recommend to use Python 3x. In the github repository and pypi package is contained the basic libraries to run `betaPBH`, but these dependences need to be import into a notebook or in into the console for functions be available.
```

2. **pip package manager:** The pip package manager is used to install betaPBH and its dependencies. It should be included with your Python installation by default.

3. **NumPy and SciPy:** The NumPy and SciPy libraries are required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. These libraries provide support for numerical computations and scientific computing in Python.

4. **Matplotlib:** The Matplotlib library is also required by betaPBH and can be installed using pip. This library provides support for creating various types of charts and graphs in Python.
